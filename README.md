- The DriverPass project was to decide how the website for customer to schedule lessons and take the written exam online. Our client was the DMV who wanted to to make getting a license more accessible to customers. 
- I felt I did particularly well with laying out a focused plan on divving up the reponsibility and also how the suystem interacts with each individual user. 
- What I feel like I could of improved on was the design choices I made as well as better describing the gnatt chart for dividing the work properly. I would improve it by having more concise notes on what it means my charts and UML diagrams describe for the client.
- The user would want to be able to see the type of packages and deals they get with each package, who they are taking as an instructor and how much they would have to pay. I wanted the UI to make as much sense and not be so clunky for the user to get confused. The product is for the user to consume so it is imperative to put the user's needs when designing a website.
- When it comes ot designing software, I would try to find out what type of audience is this for, how would I want it to look and what do I want displayed first when a new user sees the page depending if it is a website or not.
